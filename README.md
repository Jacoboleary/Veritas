# How to use?

1. Replace the contents of the strings here with your own name or whatever you want your username to be, and the pasword you want.

2. Let Veritas's simple user interface guide you the rest of the way! The instructions are very clear within the software, so I shouldn't have to explain it. Hope my tool helps!

(P.S) DO NOT mess with any of the other code unless you know what you are doing. You could break it.
